This is a task manager web application, built with AngularJS, providing a dynamic, single-page user experience for creating, updating, and deleting tasks. The backend is a PHP-based RESTful API that handles the business logic and interacts with a MySQL database to persist task data. The application is designed to help users organize their tasks into categories and track their status as either pending or completed.
